# Morse Compose — Meshpocket User Guide

Morse Compose lets you type and send messages on any configured channel using the Meshpocket's single button. No keyboard needed — just press and release in the rhythm of Morse code.

## Getting In and Out

**Enter**: Double-click the button from the home screen. A channel picker appears — click to cycle between channels, then double-click to select. The Morse compose screen opens on the chosen channel. If you have more channels than fit on the screen, the list scrolls as you cycle past the bottom, and a `^` or `v` marker appears at the right edge to show the list continues in that direction.

**Exit**: Hold the button for **9 seconds**, then release. The display shows `[EXIT]` when the threshold is reached. You can also exit by long-pressing from the channel picker.

## How Pressing Works

Every button press is either a **dot** or a **dash**, determined by how long you hold:

| Press duration | Result |
|---|---|
| Under 500 ms | Dot (·) |
| 500 ms – 3 s | Dash (—) |

A quick tap (under half a second) is a dot. A deliberate half-second hold is a dash. The threshold is generous to avoid accidental dashes.

## How Letters Form

You don't need to press "confirm" after each letter — the screen detects letter boundaries automatically from silence gaps:

| Gap (after last release) | What happens |
|---|---|
| 1 second | Current dots/dashes are decoded into a letter |
| 3.5 seconds | A space is inserted between words |

So the flow is: press dot/dash patterns → pause for about 1 second → letter appears → continue with the next letter. Pause for 3.5 seconds and a space is added.

### Example: Sending "hi there"

1. Press: · · · · (four quick taps) → pause 1 second → **h** appears
2. Press: · · (two quick taps) → pause 1 second → **i** appears
3. **Wait ~3.5 seconds** → space inserted automatically → buffer shows "hi "
4. Press: — (one half-second press) → pause → **t** appears
5. Press: · · · · → pause → **h** appears
6. Press: · → pause → **e** appears
7. Press: · — · → pause → **r** appears
8. Press: · → pause → **e** appears
9. Buffer now shows "hi there"
10. Hold for ~8 seconds → display shows `[SEND]` → release → message sent!

## Sending, Correcting, and Exiting

There are two ways to send, backspace, and exit:

### Method 1: Hold durations (easier)

Just hold the button and release at the right moment. The display shows which action is armed:

| Hold duration | Display shows | What happens on release |
|---|---|---|
| 3 – 7 s | `[BKSP]` | **Backspace** — deletes the last character |
| 7 – 9 s | `[SEND]` | **Send** — sends the message on the selected channel |
| 9 s+ | `[EXIT]` | **Exit** — returns to the home screen |

### Method 2: Prosigns (advanced)

Two special Morse patterns also work as alternatives:

| Prosign | Pattern | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| **WW** | · — — · — — | **Sends** the message (two W's without a letter gap) |
| **HH** | · · · · · · · · | **Backspace** (8 rapid dots within the 1-second letter gap) |

## Screen Layout

The Morse screen shows four sections:

- **Header**: "MORSE > channelname" showing which channel you're composing on. When a hold action is armed, `[BKSP]`, `[SEND]`, or `[EXIT]` appears on the right.
- **IN**: The last 7 incoming messages on the selected channel only (messages from other channels are filtered out). A message too long to fit its line is shown a section at a time: each section stays for 3 seconds, then the next one appears, and after the last section it loops back to the start. Nothing to press, and a long message still only uses one line.
- **OUT**: Your composed message so far, with a cursor.
- **KEY**: Shows "ready" during normal use. During a hold, shows the armed action.

Sent messages also appear in the MeshCore companion app's channel history if BLE is connected.

## Tips

- **Spaces are automatic** — just pause for about 3.5 seconds after finishing a word and a space appears
- Full stop is its own Morse character (· — · — · —) — a space is automatically inserted after it via the same word-gap pause
- All output is **lowercase**
- The maximum message length is 133 characters
- If you enter a wrong dot/dash pattern, it won't match any character and will be silently dropped — just start the letter again after the gap
- A dot is a quick tap (under half a second), a dash is a deliberate hold (half a second or longer)
- The display doesn't update during active keying to avoid blocking button presses — your letters appear when the 1-second letter gap commits them
- M (— —) requires **two separate presses**, each held for about half a second, with a brief release between them
- **Hold durations are the easiest way to send, backspace, and exit** — just hold and watch the display for `[BKSP]`, `[SEND]`, or `[EXIT]`, then release
- Long incoming messages page through by themselves. If a message in the IN list is cut off, wait and the rest will come round
- Incoming messages are stored up to 95 characters, so anything longer is trimmed before it reaches the IN list
- The WW prosign and HH prosign still work as alternatives for advanced users
